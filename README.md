# CST8918 - DevOps_FinalProject: Infrastructure as Code  
**Final Project: Terraform, Azure AKS, and GitHub Actions**  
**Group Name:** Group 11  
**Category:** FP  
**Professor:** Robert McKenney  

---

## üìå Overview

It is a culminating project that demonstrates some of the concepts learned on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) during the term. We developed the Remix Weather Application which we had already done in week 3 and we used Terraform to work with Azure resources to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters and managed Redis DB. The Terraform runs, application builds and deployments are done automatically via GitHub Actions.

The configuration has been handled in **Azure Blob Storage backend** and is divided into **modules** so that it would be possible to maintain it. This is a simulation of a real life scenario in which multiple members would be on a team in various environments (dev, test, prod).

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Static Analysis** (on push to any branch):
   - `terraform fmt`
   - `terraform validate`
   - `tfsec`

2. **PR Checks** (on pull request to main):
   - `tflint`
   - `terraform plan`
   - Build & deploy app to **test** environment (if app code changes).

3. **Deploy Infra** (on push to main):
   - `terraform apply`

4. **App Deployment**:
   - **Test:** On PR to main (app code changes).
   - **Prod:** On merge to main (app code changes).
   - Build Docker image, push to ACR, tag with commit SHA.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Flow

1. The development of feature or fix is carried out in a different branch.
2. Main triggers to PR:
   Infra PR -> Terraform plan & lint checks.
   App PR -> Build & deploy to testim.
3. Combining PR to main triggers:
   Infra changes ->Deploy to Azure.
   App changes - > Deploy to prod.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project

### **Prerequisites**
-The right subscription was logged into through the Azure CLI.
-Locally installed terraform.
-Hello, federated identity in GitHub repository.
-Local builds installed docker.

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/praj0080/CST8918_FinalProject.git)
   cd CST8918_FinalProject
   ```
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd infra
   terraform init
   ```
3. Plan & Apply:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
4. Build & push Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <acr-name>.azurecr.io/weather-app:<tag> ./app
   docker push <acr-name>.azurecr.io/weather-app:<tag>
   ```
